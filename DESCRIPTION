Description: Provides an interface to the system-level 'grep' utility for 
    efficiently reading, filtering, and aggregating data from multiple flat 
    files. By pre-filtering data at the command line before it enters the 
    R environment, the package reduces memory overhead and improves 
    ingestion speed. Includes functions for counting records across large 
    file systems and supports recursive directory searching.
