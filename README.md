The goal of `grepreaper` is to provide a fast, R-friendly interface to the system 'grep' utility. It allows you to read, filter, and aggregate data from thousands of files simultaneously without loading them all into memory.

## Installation

You can install the development version of grepreaper from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
devtools::install_github("akshat09867/grepreaper")
